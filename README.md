### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

**`IT-student with passion for cyber security`**

I'm at the end of my IT-engineer studies and actively looking for different opportunities to finish my thesis, and get some real life experience with IT-field. I have four years of experience with different IT-related topics that I've learned with university plan or by tinkering with new topics by myself.
